I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Information Engineering** at the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, **Zhejiang University**, and a selected member of the Shannon Class. I maintain a GPA of **4.78/5.00**, ranking among the **top three** students in my major.

I have a strong cross-disciplinary background in **Computer Science** and **Electrical Engineering**, with research interests centered on **embedded systems**, **signal processing**, and **edge AI deployment**. My work focuses on bridging the gap between software and hardware to bring intelligent algorithms onto resource-constrained platforms.

On the computer science side, I am proficient in C++ and Python, and experienced with building reproducible development environments using tools such as Docker and uv. I have hands-on experience deploying deep learning models on edge devices, particularly using NVIDIA Jetson platforms and TensorRT, and am deeply interested in kernel-level optimization and runtime performance on mobile and embedded hardware.

On the electrical engineering side, I have a solid foundation in analog circuit design, including multi-stage BJT operational amplifier architectures, as well as electromagnetic theory based on Maxwell's equations and signal processing. This background allows me to understand system behavior from both circuit-level and algorithmic perspectives.

I am highly motivated to pursue research that integrates algorithms, operators, and hardware, and to explore system-level co-design for efficient and scalable edge intelligence.
